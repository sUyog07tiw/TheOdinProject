<p>Hyderabadi Biryani traces its roots back to the Nizam's royal kitchen during the rule of the Nizams in Hyderabad, India. It was believed to have been introduced by the chefs of the Nizam, blending Mughlai and Telugu cuisines. This aromatic and flavorful dish gained popularity and became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine, celebrated for its unique cooking technique and rich flavors. The Hyderabadi biryani is traditionally made with basmati rice, meat (usually chicken, mutton, or beef), and a blend of spices, cooked in layers to infuse the flavors. Over time, it evolved into various versions, including the famous Hyderabadi dum biryani, known for its slow-cooked process that results in tender meat and fragrant rice.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Before beginning, gather and prepare all necessary ingredients including rice, meat, vegetables, spices, and any other flavorings required for the biryani recipe.</li>
    <li>If opting for meat, marinate it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, spices, and lemon juice for at least 30 minutes to overnight, adjusting marination duration according to the recipe's requirements.</li>
    <li>After rinsing and soaking the rice for 30 minutes, parboil it in salted water until it reaches 70-80% cooked, then drain and set aside for further use in the biryani preparation.</li>
    <li>To prepare the spice mixture, heat oil or ghee in a large pot or skillet, add whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves, then saut√© sliced onions until golden brown, followed by ginger-garlic paste until fragrant.</li>
    <li>If using meat, add the marinated meat to the pot and cook until it's partially cooked and evenly coated with the spices.</li>
    <li> For layering, use a separate large pot or deep baking dish; start with a layer of cooked rice, followed by a layer of the cooked meat and its gravy, then sprinkle with chopped mint and coriander leaves. </li>
    <li>To infuse saffron, dissolve saffron strands in warm milk and gently drizzle it over the top layer of rice, enhancing the biryani with its distinct color and aroma.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to seal in the steam, then cook the biryani on low heat (dum) for approximately 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend and the rice to fully cook.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, carefully fluff up the biryani with a fork, garnish with fried onions, nuts, and raisins if desired, and serve hot with raita or salan (a spicy gravy).</li>
