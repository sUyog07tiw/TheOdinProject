<p>Lasagna has roots tracing back to ancient times, with the earliest known recipe found in a 14th-century English cookbook. The word "lasagna" originates from the Greek word "lasanon," meaning a cooking pot or vessel. Throughout history, lasagna evolved with regional variations emerging across Italy, featuring ingredients like béchamel sauce in Emilia-Romagna and ricotta cheese in Southern Italy. Italian immigrants spread lasagna's popularity worldwide in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, making it a beloved comfort food globally. Today, lasagna remains a timeless classic in Italian cuisine, cherished for its comforting layers of pasta, cheese, and sauce.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the ingredients by gathering lasagna noodles, meat, tomato sauce, cheeses, vegetables, and seasonings.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, typically around 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the sauce by browning ground meat (if using) in a large skillet, adding chopped onions, garlic, and other vegetables, pouring in tomato sauce and seasonings, then simmering for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Prepare the cheese mixture by combining ricotta cheese, eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and any additional seasonings in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li> Assemble the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish, layering with cooked lasagna noodles, then spreading a layer of the cheese mixture on top, and repeating the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
    <li>Add cheese: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the final layer of sauce.</li>
    <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Rest and serve: Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows it to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions.</li>
    <li> Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna served with a side salad and garlic bread!</li>
