<p>Momo, a beloved dish in Nepal, is believed to have originated from Tibetan immigrants who brought their culinary traditions with them. It is thought to have evolved from Tibetan dumplings called "momos," which were traditionally filled with meat and spices. In Nepal, momo gained popularity and underwent adaptation to suit local tastes, leading to variations in fillings and flavors. The dish quickly became a staple in Nepalese cuisine, served in homes, restaurants, and street stalls across the country. Today, momo is not only enjoyed in Nepal but has also gained international recognition, delighting taste buds around the world.</p>

    <li>For a typical filling for momo, finely chop 1 cup of cabbage, 1/2 cup of carrots, and 1/4 cup of onions, then mix with 1/2 pound of minced meat (e.g., chicken, pork, or lamb), seasoning with 1 teaspoon each of salt, pepper, minced garlic, minced ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon each of ground cumin and coriander.</li>

    <li>Divide the rested dough into small balls, then roll each into palm-sized thin circles using a rolling pin.</li>
    <li>Fill the center of each dough circle with a spoonful of filling, fold it over to form a half-moon shape, and pinch and pleat the edges to seal.</li>
    <li>Place the filled momo in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves, then steam over boiling water for 10-15 minutes until cooked through and tender.</li>
